# TinyLight
Source codes for the smallest possible android flash light app, which I created specificaly to use for Bixby button of my Samsung Galaxy S10e phone. APK file less than 10KB, every time you launch the app - it toggles the state of the flash. Application itself is available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=site.tsoft.tinylighter
